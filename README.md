## Task

The goal of the work is to create a program that implements an artificial neuron; masterment of a neuron learning procedure; use of the obtained results for solving classification and approximation test problems.  

master, using the language C / C ++, a program that simulates the behavior of an artificial three-input neuron of the type specified by the teacher and provides his training for solving the problem of classification. Below is a table of options for assignments.
